## Challenge Description

You have been contracted by a luxurious mountain ski hotel & resort to keep track of all of the hotels, the rooms of that hotel, and the guests that stay there. 

* Hotels have a name and a location.
  * ex: `name: 'Echo Mountain Inn', location: 'Echo Mountain'`
* Rooms have a rate (price per night), and a suite designation. (For simplicity, let's assume the rate is a whole dollar price and use an integer.)
  * ex: `rate: 125, suite: "Presidential"`
* Guests have a name and the number of nights they'll be staying.
  * ex: `name: 'Charlize Theron', nights: 3`

## Model Setup
* Hotels have many Rooms. 
* Rooms belong to a Hotel.
* Guests have many Rooms.
* Rooms have many Guests.
Some of the initial model set up and testing has been done for you. Make sure your models & relationships are ready before starting user stories. You do not need to test for or create any model validations. 

## User Stories

```
Story 1
Guest Show

As a visitor
When I visit a guest's show page
I see the guest's name
And I see a list of all the rooms they've stayed in
including the room's suite, nightly rate, and the name of the hotel that it belongs to.
```

```
Story 2
Add a Guest to a Room

As a visitor
When I visit a guest's show page
Then I see a form to add a room to this guest.
When I fill in a field with the id of an existing room
And I click submit
Then I am redirected back to the guest's show page
And I see the room now listed under this guest's rooms.
(You do not have to test for a sad path, for example if the ID submitted is not an existing room)
```

```
Story 3
Rooms Index

When I visit the rooms index page
Then I see a list of all rooms
